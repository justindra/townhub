# Townhub Transit

Townhub's Transit module is a way for different agencies to upgrade their generally PDF Timetables to be a digital one to show the map of all the stops and also show the different route(s) available for them on each day. This module is built on top of the [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) Data structure to allow easy expansion to other areas and also allows agencies to move to another system in the future if they prefer.
